# Antok
==Aim:==

Create an Anarchist Libertarian Communist crypto-currency and socialist counter-economy.

==How it works:==

Antok is an open-source platform for anybody to setup a local assembly that can be joined by members and collectives. Serving as an organisational and resource management utility governed through direct-democractic voting procedures and bottom up hierarchy structures. Participating collectives operate in a non-profit or anarcho-syndicalist manner. Contributing any profits (after wages) to local assemblies for community control and allocation decisions. Each member is assigned a token granting equal access to goods and services and facilitating trades.

Requirements:

    Member and collective registrars
    Property, goods and services registrars
    Direct-democratic and bottom up hierarchy structures and voting platforms
    Resource management and automated distribution allocation tools
    Token system that ensures equal access to essential goods and services and can facilitate trades
    Transparent anarcho-syndicalist processes and community control of finances
    De-centralised and autonomous management mechanisms through local assemblies

==Project status:==

This is currently a solo project in planning stage. Eagerly welcoming all contributions from experienced developers and any others with useful skill-sets and ideas. Please email me at antok@tuta.io and join the GitHub project page. I will also setup a discussion forum and post social network and blog links below and update them with news and promotional content.

==Donations:==

To be straight up, I'm running this psuedo-anonymously and it's is my first open-source and C++ project, so a big learning curve. All donations will be used to fund full-time development and transaction histories publicly documented. Should this project take off and others come on board. I will de-centralise control of funds using BitCoin's multi-signature accounts feature. BitCoin isn't anti-capitalist but it's currently the only viable, global, state-less currency and best mass-scale option in a transitional Anarcho-Syndicalism period - providing public transparency and autonomy from banks. The final goal of Antok however is to make all currencies obsolete.
