# Antok
This is a open-source Libertarian Communist (Anarchist) counter economy, based on BitCoin's de-centralised block-chain crypto currency idea. It aims to provide an online platform to setup local assemblies. Which provide transparent and direct-democractic voting mechanisms, constantly community accountable hierarchy structures and resource management capabilities. And also acts as a anarcho-syndicalist tool and token system for all members and collectives to freely share public goods and services. Inspired by the CNT!
